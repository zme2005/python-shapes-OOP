# python-shapes-OOP
Project Description :
This project demonstrates the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python through a simple geometric shapes calculator. It includes classes for Circle, Square, and Rectangle, all of which inherit from an abstract base class called Shape.

The project highlights:

Use of abstract base classes with @abstractmethod

Encapsulation using private attributes and setter/getter methods

Polymorphism, demonstrated through looping over different shape objects

A structured, modular codebase with each class in a separate file

Input validation for preventing negative values
